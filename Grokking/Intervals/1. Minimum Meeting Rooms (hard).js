// Given a list of intervals representing the start and end time of ‘N’ meetings, find the minimum number of rooms required to hold all the meetings.

// Meetings: [[1,4], [2,5], [7,9]]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: Since [1,4] and [2,5] overlap, we need two rooms to hold these two meetings. [7,9] can
// occur in any of the two rooms later.
